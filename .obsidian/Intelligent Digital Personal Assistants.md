# Intelligent Digital Personal Assistants 

As the [[Internet of Things]] industry continues to take off, [[digital personal assistants]] become more proactive in their behavior to support user demands. Some popular digital personal assistants are Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, and Amazon's Alexa [ [1](#Reference) ]. Their ability to meet user demand stems from the qualities that make up their [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Some qualities are personalizability, directability, and teachability [ [2](#Reference) ]. 

# Project Execution Assistant 
The Project Execution Assistant (PEA) is a proposed system described for an intelligent personal assistant built to have time management capabilities [ [2](#Reference) ]. The time management capabilities are made possible with the previously described qualities that make up PEA's AI. 

# Augmenting Time Management by Increasing Productivity
PEA is able to relieve users of routines tasks and minimize cognitive load by adapting to user preferences / directions and behavior, and other learning over time. PEA is proposed to go as far autonomously decide whether to accept meeting requests based on constraints such as time, location, and scheduling conflicts. However, such an instance would only occur after the user accepted enough suggestions and the assistant had collected enough user preferences from passive / active learning [ [2](#Reference) ]. Therefore, with the use of PEA, users would have an increase of productivity in day-to-day functions, and would be less overwhelmed by task overload which saves cognitive function for what matters (i.e., the tasks).
