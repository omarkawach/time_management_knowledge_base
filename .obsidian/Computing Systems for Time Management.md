# Systems for Time Management

## Context on Systems for Time Management
Time management is such a fundamental part of our everyday lives. Increased stress, and decreased productivity may be implications of not honing this skill well. As a result of the increased stress, cognitive executive functions may become impaired [ [1](#References) ]. To reduce the likelihood of these stress related implications from occurring, we look to time management tools. Traditional time management tools such as paper to-do lists, and calendars have been far surpassed by modern time management tools (as evidenced by [[Digital Calendars]]). The common observed theme of these modern time management tools is that they create some form of workflow based on certain techniques. These techniques include increasing productivity by task prioritization, planning, and execution which augment time management.

## Organization of Sub-Topics

The knowledge base begins with explaining the importance of [[planning]] in time management using project management tools. Then the knowledge base goes into discussing the most classic tools for time management in this era  (i.e., [[Digital Calendars]]). The emergence of new technologies, such as AI make it possible to create new and exciting tools to augment time management skills such as [[Automatic Time Tracking]] and [[Intelligent Digital Personal Assistants]]. Lastly, to motivate users, [[Gamified Time Management]] may be suitable for maintaining time management skills.
