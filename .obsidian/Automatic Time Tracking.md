# Automatic Time Tracking
A recent innovation in the history of humankind to manage the most priceless and limited entity in our lives, 'TIME,' has led to the development of automatic time trackers or schedulers that rely on [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] technologies for intelligence.  

But what do we mean by automatic time tracking?

The user needs to download the application and let it run in the background. The application will smartly remember user patterns from all applications used throughout the day. And start generating automatic timesheets using AI capabilities.  

An excellent example is [Timely](https://memory.ai/timely), a tool by Memory AI [[1](#References)]. The tool allows users to create projects that represent significant tasks and log activities in each project. Timely then generates timesheets based on logged activities. However, the best feature is the automatic generation of timesheets for which timely integrates with another component, 'Memory'. Memory runs in the background while the user performs all daily tasks on their laptop. It captures patterns from user activities and creates time logs, and suggests them to the user. Users can either choose to map these suggestions to projects or not. This activity will further train the AI. Additionally, the tool brilliantly integrates with other tools like google calendars, monday.com, etc., to account for all user activities. 

Another great example is [Trevor AI](https://trevorai.com/),Â  a personal time management assistant which allows users to map tasks to their schedule [[2](#References)]. But the best feature is that it helps users find the most suitable time for each task by carefully analyzing the schedule, personal preference and priority of each task. Furthermore, adding tasks is as simple as sending a text to the assistant, and it automatically gets included in the user's schedule.  

## Exciting features of automatic time trackers:

-   Determine and report the user's focus time and meeting time by analyzing the schedule.
    
-   Block notifications during the user's productive time.
    
-   Help users schedule an activity they are interested in by suggesting a suitable time from the free time available in the users' timesheet.  

## Augmenting Time Management:
Mastering time management is the ultimate aim of every human. However, only a few succeed. Automatic time tracking applications are excellent examples of tools that can help humans manage time better. These applications handle all administrative scheduling tasks while the users can focus on actual productive work. Moreover, these tools are intelligent enough to identify essential tasks through analysis and map them to users' schedules.  

## Ethical Implications:
Companies developing or using these applications should follow strict privacy policies to maintain the trust of their users. Additionally, obtaining consent from users on the terms and conditions should be a prerequisite for using these tools.

  

## Future Scope:

-   Time trackers in the future should provide specific reasons for low task completion rates. A recent study by Yang et al. aimed at answering similar research questions [[3](#References)].
    
-   Time trackers should provide practical suggestions to improve time management skills.
