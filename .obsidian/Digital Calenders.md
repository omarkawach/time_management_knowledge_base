# Digital Calendars
Traditional calendars are handy planning and time management tools but, when taken digitally, become an even more powerful way for users to schedule their days down to the exact minute. According to a [survey done by ECAL](https://ecal.com/70-percent-of-adults-rely-on-digital-calendar/) around 70% of adults in Australia rely on digital calendars [[1](#References)]. Judy Wajcman argues in their paper how this reliance reflects Silicon Valley's push to improve human efficiency and maximize the amount of work we can do in as little time as possible [[2](#References)]. They go on to explain how current calendar systems are designed specifically with "intelligent time management" in mind.

## Google Calendar
Google’s calendar and reminder system is one of the most prevalent implementations of the digital calendar. 25% of digital calendar usage on mobile devices is through Google [by ECAL’s numbers](https://ecal.com/70-percent-of-adults-rely-on-digital-calendar/) [[1](#References)]. Unsurprisingly, another 25% use Apple’s calendar system instead, although this page will focus on the former. 

Google allows various kinds of events and reminders to be set up in different ways, to maximize the efficiency in which schedules can be off loaded from the mind into the calendar system. A given event can be configured to last for any stretch of time, at any point in the user’s future. These can be made into recurring events as well, and reminders can be set up to inform users when events start or are coming up.

## Augmenting Time Management
By inputting upcoming and recurring events into Google Calendar the user no longer need concern themselves with when and when not to work on those tasks, provided they stick to their schedule. Through this one can focus more on the task at hand and spend less time scheduling on the fly.

Additionally, by clearly setting expectations for what tasks are to be done by what times, it stands to reason there is a better chance of them actually being started as opposed to freeforming a schedule in the moment.

Taken to its extremes, this can cut out the need for the user to keep track of time at all, so long as they switch focus when the calendar notifies them of start and end times. This extreme stance is not really realistic however, as being aware of how long is left for a certain task will inform how it should be carried out. 

## Other Affected Areas
As with many tools, Google Calendar benefits more than just Time Management as is probably clear already. Memory is the other major affected area, as the calendar makes remembering times and even locations of upcoming events less crucial. A person’s habits are also influenced, as it can be easier to keep a habit when given recurring reminders, as can be done with Google Calendar (to take out the trash or practice piano for example).

## Other Tools
Assuming tasks and events are inputted diligently, digital calendars can be used similarly to [[Automatic Time Tracking]] tools given they will contain records of current and past events for analysis. 

Digital Calendars are useful [[planning]] tools as well, allowing for users to construct schedules in advance, letting them focus on tasks at hand instead of planning immediate next steps.
