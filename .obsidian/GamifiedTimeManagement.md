# Gamified Time Management
The idea of gamification in a time-management system aims to utilize game elements for motivating users to finish their tasks with lower resistance. Emotion cognitive augmentation is a related topic to such an idea.

## Augmenting Task Prioritisation
Cassells and Broin designed a system where the users are presented with a tournament of tasks to be completed [[1](#References)]. The games are arranged until the tasks are sorted with priority. In a match, the task with a lower priority is eliminated. For example, one can choose the task of finishing an assignment over grocery shopping. According to the researchers, gamification showed a significant positive impact on the emotional states of intrinsic motivation and enjoyment.

## Augmenting Time Management Skills
A different approach of time-management augmentation achieves the goal by enhancing human behaviours. A prototype designed by Chen et al. is using gamification for behaviour change through time-management traning for primary school students [[2](#References)]. There are five steps in the training: 
    
    1) Time perception 
    2) Goal setting
    3) Goal division
    4) Strategy making
    5) Execution
    6) Feedback

Gamification designs, such as storytelling, challenges, strategy, rewards, partner, immediate feedback, points, badges and progress bar, play as a motive of behaviour change in the model. For example, a rewarding system motivates users to continue their actions. By taking social interactions into account, the willingness for action is triggered at the feedback by obtaining rewards for accomplishing a task. Moreover, portraying tasks as monsters to challenge against can help trainees to complete the jobs. 

The research suggests that time-management skills learned through the behaviour change model are stored in the short-term memory. The willingness to follow the training manual was also increased.

## Habitica
An exemplary software, [Habitica](https://habitica.com/), presents gamified scheduling functions. It lets the users add tasks in the system and rewards them with coins when they are accomplished. The coins can be used to buy in-game items. Users can create groups and share their achievements. Some quests and challenges motivate them to be involved with the gamified time-management.
