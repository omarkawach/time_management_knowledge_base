# Digital Calendars
According to a [survey done by ECAL](https://ecal.com/70-percent-of-adults-rely-on-digital-calendar/) around 70% of adults in Australia rely on digital calendars. 

These calendars provide a convenient way to quantify and plan out one’s time, allowing tasks to be allotted to the exact minute.

## Google Calendar
Google’s calendar and reminder system is one of the most prevalent implementations of the digital calendar. 25% of digital calendar usage on mobile devices is through Google [by ECAL’s numbers](https://ecal.com/70-percent-of-adults-rely-on-digital-calendar/). Unsurprisingly, another 25% use Apple’s calendar system instead, although this page will focus on the former. 

Google allows various kinds of events and reminders to be set up in different ways, to maximize the efficiency in which schedules can be off loaded into the calendar system. A given event can be configured to last for any stretch of time, at any point in the user’s future. These can be made into recurring events as well, and reminders can be set up to inform users when events start or are coming up.

## Augmenting Time Management
By inputting upcoming and recurring events into Google Calendar the user no longer need concern themselves with when and when not to work on those tasks, provided they stick to their schedule. Through this one can focus more on the task at hand and spend less time scheduling on the fly.

Additionally, by clearly setting expectations for what tasks are to be done by what times, it stands to reason there is a better chance of them actually being started as opposed to freeforming a schedule in the moment.

Taken to its extremes, this can cut out the need for the user to keep track of time at all, so long as they switch focus when the calendar notifies them of start and end times. This is not really realistic however, as being aware of how long is left for a certain task is generally good to know. 


## Other Affected Areas
As with many tools, Google Calendar benefits more than just Time Management as is probably clear already. Memory is the other major affected area, as the calendar makes remembering times and even locations of upcoming events less crucial. A person’s habits are also influenced, as it can be easier to keep a habit when given recurring reminders, as can be done with Google Calendar (to take out the trash or practice piano for example).
